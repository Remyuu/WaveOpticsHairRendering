# WaveOpticsHairRendering
 A customized PBRT-v4 project for wave-optics-based hair rendering using NS-FDTD simulation and precomputed BxDF tables.

 This repository contains a customized version of [PBRT-v4](https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v4) for wave-optics-based hair rendering, as part of my undergraduate thesis. The project implements a scattering model for hair fibers based on wave optics principles, simulated using the Non-Standard Finite-Difference Time-Domain (NS-FDTD) method. It also integrates precomputed BxDF tables for efficient rendering.
